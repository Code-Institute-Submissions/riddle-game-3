<h1>Python Project - Riddle Game</h1>

A project which uses fundamental python concepts learnt in the Code Insitute Full-Stack Development course.

The aim of the game is for the user to supply answers to riddles displayed on the screen. Their score is tracked throughout the session, with the user's answers compared with the correct answer stored in a local JSON file.

Incorrect answers for a particular riddle previously given by any user are stored in a CSV file, and read to the screen when that riddle is reached.

Things still left to implement:

- High score table
- Celebration animation if game is completed
- Make more aesthetically pleasing (apply CSS)
- Deploy application to Heroku
